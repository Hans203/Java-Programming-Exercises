# **Abstract Class and Methods**

## The Incredibles

The Incredibles family is a group of superheroes, each with unique abilities. You are tasked with designing a Java-based system to represent these characters and their powers. The system should follow object-oriented principles, specifically making use of abstract classes and methods where appropriate.

The superhero family consists of:

1. Mr. Incredible (Bob Parr) -- Possesses super strength.
2. Elastigirl (Helen Parr) -- Can stretch her body.
3. Violet Parr -- Has invisibility and can generate force fields.
4. Dash Parr -- Has super speed.
5. Jack-Jack Parr -- Has multiple powers (laser eyes, shape-shifting, teleportation, etc.).

Each superhero should have:

- A name and superpower (which varies for each).
- A method to use their power (which differs for each character).
- A method to display their identity.

The base class should be designed in a way that some functionalities are common across all superheroes, while others need to be implemented uniquely for each superhero.

Your Task:

1. Design the appropriate class hierarchy, ensuring that common properties and behaviours are placed in a base class.
2. Identify which class should be abstract and which methods should be abstract.
3. Implement the superhero classes such that each character correctly overrides necessary methods.
4. Create a main method to instantiate the superhero objects and demonstrate polymorphism by calling their methods dynamically.
