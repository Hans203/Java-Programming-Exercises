Dholakpur thrives under the rule of its wise king. **Chhota Bheem**, the village's mightiest warrior, along with his friends, defends Dholakpur from enemies like Kalia and external invaders.

The kingdom follows **strict rules**:

1. **The Royal Laws cannot be changed** -- No one should be able to override or modify them.

2. **The King's Title is Unchangeable** -- Once a person becomes king, their title remains fixed.

3. **Bheem's Strength and Fighting Style are Legendary** -- No other warrior should modify them.

4. **Regular Warriors Can Have Their Own Fighting Style** -- Unlike Bheem, regular warriors can fight differently.

Implement the following classes:

- **RoyalRules (Represents kingdom laws)**
- **King (Represents the ruler of Dholakpur)**
- **Warrior (Represents any warrior who protects Dholakpur)**
- **ChhotaBheem (Extends Warrior and has a fixed fighting style)**
- **Kalia (Extends Warrior and tries to fight differently)**

1. **Identify which class, variable, and method should be marked as final** based on the given rules.
2. **Ensure the royal laws, the king's title, and Chhota Bheem's fighting style remain unchanged.**
3. **Allow regular warriors (like Kalia) to override methods, but restrict modifications for Chhota Bheem.**
