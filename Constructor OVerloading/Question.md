## Constructor Overloading

You are starting a new company and despite being a data scientist you want to demonstrate to your team how to code a system for managing characters from a popular anime series called "Elemental Warriors." The series features characters with unique abilities based on different elements (e.g., fire, water, earth, air). Each character has a distinct identity. Some characters also hold special titles that signify their rank or role in the series. Consider the following:

---

### Character Creation:
- Characters can be created with just their basic information.
- Characters will have a distinct ability.
- Certain characters might also have a special title.

---

### Character Management:
- The system should allow updating the ability of the characters.
- It should provide a way to display character details, with options for detailed or summary views.

---

### Data Variables:
- `name (String)`: The name of the character.
- `age (int)`: The age of the character.
- `Ability (String)`: A list of abilities the character possesses.
- `title (String)`: The special title of the character (optional).

---

### Design and Implementation Notes:
- Implement constructor overloading to handle different ways of creating a character.
- Provide method to display character details.

---

### Example:

- Create a character named **"Aang"** who is **12 years old** and has the ability **"Airbending."**
- Create a character named **"Zuko"** who is **16 years old**, has the ability **"Firebending"** and holds the title **"Fire Lord."**
- Create a character named **"Katara"** who is **14 years old** and has the ability **"Waterbending."**
