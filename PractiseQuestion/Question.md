## **Hogwarts House System**

**Write** **Java program** based on the Hogwarts house system that efficiently manages house assignments and points.

At **Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry**, students are sorted into one of four houses: **Gryffindor, Slytherin, Hufflepuff, or Ravenclaw**. Each house maintains a shared score, and whenever a student earns or loses points, it updates the total house points.

Additionally, **the Sorting Hat** is responsible for assigning students to houses. It follows a predefined sorting mechanism and remains unchanged throughout the school's history.

- Write a **Java program** that includes the following:

1. A mechanism to **assign students to a house** when they are admitted.

2. A method to **track and update house points**, ensuring that any changes reflect correctly for all members of that house.

3. A predefined **set of rules for initializing house details** before any student is sorted.

4. A way to **display the current points** for a house after updates.

5. Demonstrate the working of the system by **creating multiple students** and modifying house points accordingly.
